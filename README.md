# Nullable

This repository is under heavy construction.

The nullable package provides an [Active Support](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html)
inspired syntax sugar on top of the nullable data types provided by the standard
[database/sql](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/database/sql) package.
The interface should feel natural to those who are familiar with [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails).

## Motivation

Go's standard library provides precisely what it should: Well thought-out
primitive building blocks for specific purposes. Syntax sugar like the ones
provided by this package is subjective, hence the inception of this package.
